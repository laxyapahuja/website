The show has to bend the film making rules really badly for it to be eligible to hit the spot. The End of the F***ing World is one of those shows. \n\nI love it, not because it's relatable or that I resonate with the themes that are highlighted in the series but because I genuinely think it's one of the best shows objectively. It has the right amount of experimentation done in the right way. It's an experience and it's done better in this medium (as opposed to the book). There's no centralised message (or not one that I could gather) but a string of realisations throughout the show that makes you feel like you've actually learnt something. \n\nA lot of stuff happens in a very short time. Everything in this show is rushed but that is not necessarily a bad thing. The fact that the show treats big plot twists as ordinary story devices is a good thing in its own way. You never get disappointed and the show has to do an even better job to top what had already been the best scene till that point. \n\nThe storytelling is done right. The colours are beautiful. The jump cuts make sense. It really feels like a lot of work was done before actually releasing it. The comedy is done right visually as well as narratively.\n\nThis show goes on for just about 2 hours 40 minutes, the average size of a film split into 8 episodes (which is a unique decision as well) shows it in a way that is so creatively unique and aesthetic. The show starts almost like a satire. That's what I thought in the beginning and I'm pretty sure the book was intended to be a satire too (I haven't read the book yet) but on completing season 1, it became apparent how the inhumane nature of the characters at the beginning of the series was just \"teenagers being teenagers\" and to make the end character development even more interesting and drastic while being accurate.\n\n- Spoiler Alert\n\n    James, an introvert who has shut his feelings off ever since his mom committed suicide in front of him and Alyssa, an extrovert who never really got the attention from both her parents from a very young age. Her dad left her and her mom was too caught up with bringing her life together. \n\nThe soundtrack is indescribable. It matches the tone of the show perfectly. I watched the show around 2 years back and I still listen to the soundtrack to this day. I think it's genius how they use calm songs during morbid scenes. It really confuses the audience and bends our perspective on how we perceive a particular scene. You're confused if you should be sickened by the gore they're showing in the frame or if you should enjoy the song playing in the background. \n\nThe episodic nature allows there to be cliffhangers even if the total story is the size of one movie. There are so many 4th wall breaks and foreshadowing which just goes on to show how this is nothing like the typical Netflix cliches. The costumes are very well done as well. (Especially Alyssa's wedding dress and James's funeral clothes in S2. The contrasting effect is prevalent here too!)\n\nThe characters are likable and their behaviour seems justified even if it's erratic. The actors did a wonderful job playing teenagers while actually being almost a decade older their characters.\n\nAll in all, I'm very glad that this show turned out like how it is right now. No one could have done it better. The more I say about this series, the more I feel like I'm not appreciating it enough. I say my thanks to the directors, writers, producers, actors, art directors, cinematographers, casting directors, costume designers and everyone who made this show a reality.",
